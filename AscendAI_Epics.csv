Epic,"EPIC-1: Foundational Skeleton & Deployment Pipeline","Goal: Establish a fully containerized, multi-service local development environment with a robust CI/CD pipeline. By the end of this epic, a developer can start all services with one command, and a user can authenticate via OAuth, have their session validated by the backend, and access a protected route, with all changes validated by an automated quality gate."
